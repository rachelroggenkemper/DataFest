DataFest 2024 - Team R-sonists: C.R.A.K.ing the Code to Improve Student Learning

My team, the R-sonists, participated in Cal Poly's first DataFest in 2024, a 48-hour data analysis competition. Our task was to analyze a given dataset and present our findings through a concise slide presentation. Despite the time constraints, our team was able to come up with valuable insights and recommendations to improve student learning.

Achievement: Best in Show (out of 10 teams)

This project provided valuable insights into how student learning could be improved based on data-driven recommendations. Our analysis and presentation helped us secure the Best in Show award at Cal Poly's DataFest 2024.
